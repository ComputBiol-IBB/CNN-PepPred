# CNN-PepPred
CNN-PepPred is a tool to create convolutional NN models for the discovery of patterns in peptide sets.
More information and application to peptide-MHC class II binding prediction can be found in the User's guide (users_guide.pdf).
The folder "CNN-PepPred" contains the method and the folder "IEDBdata_CV" contains the peptide sets retrived from the IEDB website.
